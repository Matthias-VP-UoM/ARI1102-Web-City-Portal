            <p><u>The Inquisitor’s summer palace:</u> This palace was built in 1625 and today it is the official residence of the Maltese Prime Minister.</p>
            <p>Girgenti Palace is located close to Siggiewi, not far off from the southern coast of Malta. The palace was built by Inquisitor Onorto Visconti in 1625, and this is why it’s also known as the Inquisitor’s Palace.</p>
            <p>There are impressive views of the surrounding countryside and gardens, which are naturally irrigated by a number of springs. There is also a chapel onsite, dedicated to San Carlo Borromeo that was built in 1763.</p>

            <p><u>The Parish Church:</u> The great baroque parish church, dedicated to St Nicholas of Bari was constructed by the villagers who raised money themselves between 1676 and 1693. It was designed by the Maltese architect, Lorenzo Gafà but the portico and naves were added in the second half of the 19th century. The titular painting is by the famous Mattia Preti, while the titular statue was crafted by Pietro Felici in 1736. The same sculptor created the stone statue that still stands in the central square of the Siggiewi.</p>
