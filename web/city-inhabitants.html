            <p>Dr Nicholas Zammit (1815–1899) was a Maltese medical doctor, an architect, an artistic designer, and a major philosopher. His area of specialisation in philosophy was chiefly ethics. Throughout his philosophical career he did not adhere to just one intellectual position. Roughly two-thirds into his life, Zammit passed from a liberal way of thinking to a conservative one. This does not mean that there are no carry-overs, developments, or continuations between the two phases, or that Zammit himself acknowledged such a division. Notwithstanding, the development suggests that an analysis of Zammit's works will reveal different attitudes, dispositions, emphasis, and conclusions of the two periods.</p>

            <p>Karmenu Vassallo (1913–1987) was a Maltese poet, politician, and journalist. Vassallo wrote works in Maltese, Italian and English. His poems in Maltese were translated into French by Laurent Ropa, into Italian by Vincenzo Maria Pellegrini and Giovanni Curmi and into English by Professor AJ Arberry. He won many prizes in literary poetry contests. In 1972 Vassallo was awarded the gold medal Ļużė Muscat Azzopardi. He is also known as the Poet of Fire. His poetry with the influence of the Italian poet Leopardi expresses human suffering, the sadness and anger of life and the rebellion of youth. In Vassallo's poems one finds deep spirituality and Christian philosophical principles.</p>
